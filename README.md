# Detecting Human Posture Using a Convolutional Deep Neural NetworkÂ¶


## Experiment Objective
Create a deep learning neural network that can detect human posture from silhouettes. This dataset contains 1200 images for each of the following postures:

1. Sitting
2. Standing
3. Bending
4. Lying

The dataset comes with each image resized to the dimension of 512x512 px. Images have not been labeled directly but have been placed in respective class folders based off the posture in the image.
