# Detecting Human Posture Using a Convolutional Deep Neural NetworkÂ¶


## Experiment Objective
Create a deep learning neural network that can detect human posture from silhouettes. This dataset contains 1200 images for each of the following postures:

1. Sitting
2. Standing
3. Bending
4. Lying

The dataset comes with each image resized to the dimension of 512x512 px. Images have not been labeled directly but have been placed in respective class folders based off the posture in the image.

## Results
Using epochs=15, and batch size=32, we were able to achieve a 91.5% accuracy on our validation data with our custom estimator. Therefore, our CNN was able to successfully classify human silhouette photos with 91.5% accuracy.

With the same parameters and data, we re-ran our model using fit instead of the estimator and found very similar results with validation accuracy of 91% and a training accuracy of 90%.

After about epoch 15, overfitting begins to occur. The graph of accuracy above extrapolated further would clearly indicate overfitting, so we stop at 15.

Overall, our model performs well, but further tuning of the hyperparameters in each layer of the CNN should help to increase accuracy on new data.
